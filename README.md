# Sa-Sampler
 Key and Midi binded audio sampling application for live-play

## Usage
 **Sa sampler** is made with musician live-playing in mind. In it's current form, sa sampler is a simple, easy to use web app in which samples can be played via key-bindings, midi-bindings, mouse-click or touch.

 The project is populated with free samples, which users may replace with their own samples via the menu.

## Keybindings

## Midi
 The midi-binding layout is currently specific to the layout of the Novation Launchpad mk1.

## Roadmap

#### Client-side caching
 So that users may add samples, and have those attributions carry over multiple sessions, this project requires client-side caching when assigning samples to pads.

#### Variable-binding
 Ideally, this project will include features to allow users to customise their key and midi binding to correlate with their specific devices.

#### Responsivity
 As this project was originally developed to serve my singular use-case, the ideal viewport is above 1100px in width. To serve a broader set of use-cases, this project would be dynamically responsive for smaller screens.
